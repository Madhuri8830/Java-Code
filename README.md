# Java Code Repository

A collection of Java projects and assignments organized by task.

## Projects

- **Task-1-Calculator**: Calculator application
- **Task-2-Student-Management**: Student management system
- **Task-3-Library-Management**: Library management system

## Task-3: Library Management System

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

- **Abstraction**: Library class hides implementation details
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Inheritance**: Class relationships
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding capability
- **Constructor Chaining**: Using this() in constructors
- **Classes & Objects**: Book, User, Library classes

### Running the Program

```
bash
cd Task-3-Library-Management
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Getting Started

Each task folder contains its own Java source files. Compile and run them individually using Java compiler.
